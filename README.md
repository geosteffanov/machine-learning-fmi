 1. 'models' - this directory contains all machine learning projects/tasks
	       I have undertaken and/or completed. 
 2. 'plot_examples' - this directory contains examples of plots. Plotting and
		      data visualization is of utmost importance in data science
		      and I am focusing a significant effort in learning the best
		      practices in that aspect too.
